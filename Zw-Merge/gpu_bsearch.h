/*
 * gpu_bsearch.h — Improvement 2: Shared-memory tile sort + Parallel co-rank merge
 * Phase 1 — same shared-memory tile sort as gpu_smem (TILE_SIZE tiles).
 * Phase 2 — fully parallel merge using the co-rank algorithm.
 *            Each output position is assigned to its own thread.
 *            The thread uses binary search (O(log width)) to determine
 *            which of the two input runs contributes its element,
 *            eliminating the sequential bottleneck of the naive merge.
 * Returns total kernel time in ms (excludes H2D / D2H transfers).
